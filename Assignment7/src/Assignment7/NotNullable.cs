     * --The biggest problem with making a particular property not null is that
     * now our assumptions in the outside world don't match our reality. In other words,
     * if im in a particular situation where i need to assign my Value property to null maybe for
     * error checking or edge cases or just because i need that sort of functionality, Im going to create a sh** ton
     * of problems for myself by removing this ability to not exist from my property. Namely when im trying to check for invalid
     * data rather than for data that is just default. Like maybe in a situation where a user on a website makes a new profile name,
     * the default value is different then the empty string value. (Billion Dollar Problem)
     *
     * --Another problem with this is that even though the generic type (Value property) is not nullable, the reference it is wrapped in (aka our class) is nullable.
     * There is nothing we could find that prevents the user from writing the following code.
     *
     *   NotNullableReference<SomeClass> theClass = new NotNullableReference<SomeClass>;
     *   theClass = null;
     *
     * --Because we call the default value constructor of the generic type whenever Value would be set to null,
     *   we have to constrain the generic to only be compatible with types that have a default construct for us to call.
     *   This limits the number of types our class will be compatible with.
