/*
 * Caveats:
 * -By making the Value variable a class we allow the value being null, so we must explicitly check for null values
 * -A reference type will only need to copy a reference of the object.
 *     whereas a value type must be copied over every time it is accessed.
 * -By adding the constraint that the value is a class it ensures the passed objects is a reference type
 *    
 * A struct would ensure the value passed into the ctor is not null (because it is a value type)
 *     this would be enforced at compile time.
