# Assignment 6

## Coding Excercise (due 11/06/2018)
* Create a flags enum for the days of the week => `IEvent.cs`
* Create an enum for the quarters (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) in a school year => `IEvent.cs`
* Create a struct that will store only a Time value (hour, minute, second) => `IEvent.cs`
* Create a struct called Schedule that has the following properties  => `IEvent.cs`
* Write unit tests that verify the following => `EventTests.cs`

* Create a separate class and struct for performing the following tests (this is needed because we aren't going to be following best practices for the struct in these tests). => `Car.cs`
  * Create a struct and class that has some read/write properties => `Truck.cs`
  * Write tests that show the following behavior => `VehicleTests.cs`

## Coding Guidlines

* **All production code should be unit tested.  And, although we can't verify it, you are encouraged to do so following a TDD process.**
* **All projects should have project properties set so that warnings are reported as errors by the compiler**
* **Follow all coding guidelines for chapters covered** - Except where called out in the second part of the assignment
